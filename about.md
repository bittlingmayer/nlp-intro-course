I am teaching a one-week section on natural language processing as part of a four-month course on machine learning for engineers and mathematicians.

The course is funded by a public companies and startups that need talented people with practical know-how.

It's earth year 2017, and the field is changing faster than usual.  The first lecture gives some background on the ideas of the 1990s and 2000s, but the code for some of the projects will probably not compile in a year.

### Requirements 

Prerequisite knowledge: machine learning basics, prerequisites for machine learning basics (python, git, pip, virtualenv, mathematics...) and 2+ natural languages and 2+ scripts

System requirements: prerequisites for machine learning basics (ideally Unix-based with python3, but GPU not required)
