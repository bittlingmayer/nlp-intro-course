What problems are considered NLP, what the motivation is, why language is hard, why humans are good at it, what structure and mathematical properties language has, why rules-based doesn't scale, what is solved, what is unsolved, what is unsolvableâ€¦

Change the cost function, use context, use the subword level, preprocess, add more data...
