### About the course

I am teaching the natural language processing, as a one-week section of a four-month course on machine learning for engineers and mathematicians.  The goal is to teach a mix of theory and practical know-how.

It's earth year 2017, and the field is changing faster than usual.  The first lecture gives some background on the ideas of the 1990s and 2000s, but the code for some of the projects will probably not compile in a year.

## Day 1: NLP Background

### Lecture 1

What kinds of problems fall under the NLP umbrella, why language is hard, why humans are good at it, why rules-based doesn't scale, what is solved, what is unsolved, what is unsolvable…

### Lecture 2
We cover the language of language: anaphora, BLEU, canonicalisation, grammars, lemmatisation, n-grams, parallel corpora, segmentation, tokenisation, Zipf's law...

### Homework:
Increase the accuracy of Peter Norvig's classic [spelling corrector in half a page of code](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) without hurting performance too much.

Supplementary reading: watch [Lecture 1 from Stanford's *Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ), understand the title of each chapter of [Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing](https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/).

## Day 2: Deep Learning for NLP


### Homework:
spaCy

Supplementary reading: read [Manning: *Last Words: Computational Linguistics and Deep Learning*](mitp.nautil.us/article/170/last-words-computational-linguistics-and-deep-learning)

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bittlingmayer/nlp-intro-course/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
