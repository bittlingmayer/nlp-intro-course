### About the course

I am teaching natural language processing in one intense week to talented engineers and mathematicians.

The goal is just enough theory, literacy and hands-on experience to work with natural language in industry.

## Day 1: Background

### Lecture 1

What problems are considered NLP, what the motivation is, why language is hard, why humans are good at it, what structure and mathematical properties language has, why rules-based doesn't scale, what is solved, what is unsolved, what is unsolvableâ€¦ and language beyond English.

### Lecture 2
We cover the language of language: anaphora, BLEU, canonicalisation, grammars, lemmatisation, n-grams, parallel corpora, segmentation, tokenisation, Zipf's law...

### Lab:
Increase the accuracy of Peter Norvig's classic [spelling corrector in half a page of code](http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html) without hurting performance too much.

Watch [Lecture 1 from Stanford's *Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ)  
Understand the title of each chapter of [Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing](https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/)  
Try to understand [how `str` works in python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/unicode.html#python-s-unicode-support)

## Day 2: Deep Learning

### Lecture 1
Motivation for deep learning, trade-offs of preprocessing, autoencoders and word embeddings, doc vectors vs word vectors vs char vectors, comparison to old-school techniques like TF-IDF and LSA

### Lecture 2
Generating data

### Lab
spaCy
